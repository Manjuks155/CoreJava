		Within the same package: A protected member (field or method) is fully accessible from any class within the same package, 
								regardless of whether it's a subclass or not. 
		Outside the package: This is where the nuance lies.

		Through Inheritance: A protected member can be accessed from a subclass located in a different package. 
							However, this access is restricted: you must access the protected member using an instance of the subclass itself 
							(or a subclass of that subclass), not an instance of the superclass.
		Without Inheritance (Non-subclass): A protected member cannot be accessed from a class in a different package 
											if that class is not a subclass of the class containing the protected member.
